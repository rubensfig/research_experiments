This include slots used to issue uops that do not eventually get retired and slots for which the issue-pipeline was blocked due to recovery from earlier incorrect speculation.

These slots are either wasted by uops fetched from an incorrectly speculated program path; or stalls when the out-of-order part of the machine needs to recover its state from a speculative path.",

These slots are either wasted by uops fetched prior to the clear; or stalls the out-of-order portion of the machine needs to recover its state after the clear.

Backend is the portion of the processor core where the out-of-order scheduler dispatches ready uops into their respective execution units; and once completed these uops get retired according to program order. For example; stalls due to data-cache misses or stalls due to the divider unit being overloaded are both categorized under Backend Bound. Backend Bound is further divided into two main categories: Memory Bound and Core Bound.",

Memory Bound estimates fraction of slots where pipeline is likely stalled due to demand load or store instructions. This accounts mainly for (1) non-completed in-flight memory demand loads which coincides with execution units starvation; in addition to (2) cases where stores could impose backpressure on the pipeline when many of them get buffered at the same time (less common out of the two).",

However; in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores; a load might suffer due to high latency even though it is being satisfied by the L1. Another example is loads who miss in the TLB. These cases are characterized by execution unit stalls; while some non-completed demand load lives in the machine without having that demand load missing the L1 cache.",

TLBs (Translation Look-aside Buffers) are processor caches for recently used entries out of the Page Tables that are used to map virtual- to physical-addresses by the operating system. This metric approximates the potential delay of demand loads missing the first-level data TLB (assuming worst case scenario with back to back misses to different pages). This includes hitting in the second-level TLB (STLB) as well as performing a hardware page walk on an STLB miss.",

        "metric_TMA_......Data_Sharing(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles while the memory subsystem was handling synchronizations due to data-sharing accesses. Data shared by multiple Logical Processors (even just read shared) may cause increased access latency due to cache coherency. Excessive data sharing can drastically harm multithreaded performance.",
        "metric_TMA_......MEM_Bandwidth(%)": "This metric estimates fraction of cycles where the core's performance was likely hurt due to approaching bandwidth limits of external memory (DRAM).  The underlying heuristic assumes that a similar off-core traffic is generated by all IA cores. This metric does not aggregate non-data-read requests by this logical processor; requests from other IA Logical Processors/Physical Cores/sockets; or other non-IA devices like GPU; hence the maximum external memory bandwidth limits may or may not be approached when this metric is flagged (see Uncore counters for that).",

Even though store accesses do not typically stall out-of-order CPUs; there are few cases where stores can lead to actual stalls. This metric will be flagged should RFO stores be a bottleneck.",
        "metric_TMA_..Core_Bound(%)": "This metric represents fraction of slots where Core non-memory issues were of a bottleneck.  Shortage in hardware compute resources; or dependencies in software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence it may indicate the machine ran out of an out-of-order resource; certain execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or instruction-flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-latency arithmetic operations).",

Two distinct categories can be attributed into this metric: (1) heavy data-dependency among contiguous instructions would manifest in this metric - such cases are often referred to as low Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP). (2) Contention on some hardware execution unit other than Divider. For example; when there are too many multiply operations.",

Ideally; all pipeline slots would be attributed to the Retiring category.  Retiring of 100% would indicate the maximum Pipeline_Width throughput was achieved.  Maximizing Retiring typically increases the Instructions-per-cycle (see IPC metric). Note that a high Retiring value does not necessary mean there is no room for more performance.  For example; Heavy-operations or Microcode Assists are categorized under Retiring. They often indicate suboptimal performance and can often be optimized or avoided. ",

This correlates with total number of instructions used by the program. A uops-per-instruction (see UopPI metric) ratio of 1 or less should be expected for decently optimized software running on Intel Core/Xeon products.
